                        explanation: "Clonidine stimulates presynaptic alpha-2 receptors in the brainstem, which inhibits sympathetic vasomotor centers, leading to reduced norepinephrine release and decreased blood pressure. Also used for ADHD."

                        explanation: "Dobutamine is used in acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock due to its strong positive inotropic effect (increased contractility) via beta-1 receptor stimulation, with relatively less chronotropic effect compared to other beta agonists."
